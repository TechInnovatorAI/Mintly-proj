# Can I Create My Own Market? 

Users cannot create their own markets, but are encouraged to suggest ideas for new markets. The best ways to suggest a new market are: 

1. On Twitter / X by tagging @polymarket 
2. On Discord in the #market-suggestion channel

To give your market suggestion the best chance of being listed, include as much information as possible, such as: 

Name of the market 
Evidence of demand for trading the market
Does the market have any social or news value?
What is the exact question the market will answer?
What is the proposed source of resolution for the market?
