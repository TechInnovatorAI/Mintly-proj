Recommended Bridges
-------------------

For large deposits (>$50,000) originating from a chain other than Polygon, we recommend using one of the following bridges. Ensure you bridge to your Polymarket Polygon deposit address (screenshot below). Please be mindful of potential slippage during the transaction.

-   DeBridge
-   Across
-   Portal

Important Notes
---------------

You can deposit USDC or USDC.e to your Polymarket Polygon wallet.

If you deposit USDC (native), you will be prompted to "activate funds," which will swap this to USDC.e via the lowest fee Uniswap pool, ensuring slippage of less than 10 basis points (bps).

If you encounter any issues with the deposit process, please reach out to us on Discord for assistance.
