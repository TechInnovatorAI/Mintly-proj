### Using the Order Book
Understanding the Order Book will help you become an advanced trader.
In the Getting Started tutorial on [Making your First Trade](), we learned about market orders.

 In a market order, your trade executes instantly at the current market price.
But what if you think the market price is too high and want to set a specific price that you would be willing to accept? These are called [Limit Orders](). 

### Viewing the Order Book
The order book is a list of every open order to buy or sell shares in a particular market.

In this market, “Who will win the US 2024 Republican presidential nomination”, we are viewing the order book for Trump “Yes” shares.

The green side represents the “bid”: the highest price traders are willing to pay to buy Trump “Yes” shares.

The red side represents the “ask”: the lowest price traders are willing to accept to sell Trump “Yes” shares.

<Tip>
Notice that there is a 2c gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask price. This is referred to as the spread.

### Managing Open Orders
When you have an open order, you'll find it displayed just below the Order Book on the market's page. If you have open orders across multiple markets, you can easily manage and monitor them all from the [Portfolio page](https://polymarket.com/portfolio?tab=Open+orders).

In this example, you have an open order to buy 20 Yes shares at 70c. So far, 0 shares have been ‘filled’ from your order.

To cancel the order, you can simply click the red **x** button alongside the order.
