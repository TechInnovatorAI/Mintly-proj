No, Polymarket is not the house. 

Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market where traders interact directly with each other.

Polymarket is a marketplace comprised of traders on both sides of any given market. This means you're always trading with other users, not against a centralized entity or "house." Prices on Polymarket are determined by supply and demand. As traders buy and sell shares in outcomes, prices fluctuate to reflect the collective sentiment and knowledge of the market participants. 

One of the key benefits of Polymarket is the ability to sell your position at any time before the market resolves. This offers flexibility and allows you to manage your risk and lock in profits or cut losses as you see fit.

In essence, Polymarket empowers you to trade based on your own knowledge and research, without the fear of going up against a "house" with potentially unfair advantages.
